								<h2 class="major_1">Intro</h2>
								<p>My name is Daniel, I am 22 years old, and I have been working in the field of industrial automation since graduating from high school at the age of 19.<br>
								It began as a technical curiosity and quickly grew into <a href="#work"> solid career path</a>, giving me the opportunity to build a strong foundation across every stage of the process —from electrical wiring to developing advanced software solutions.<br>
								Today, I work as a traveling software engineer, overseeing commissioning and on-site implementation projects, and ensuring that systems operate reliably in real-world conditions.<br>
								I am not afraid of challenging schedules, long hours, or unusual shifts if that is what it takes to deliver results and meet project goals.
								At the same time, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering. Balancing work and study allows me to connect academic knowledge with hands-on industry experience, helping me grow as both an engineer and a problem-solver.<br>
								Driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a strong work ethic, I aim to continue developing my skills while contributing to projects that demand both precision and creativity.</p>
